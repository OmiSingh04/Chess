## Chess Piece ID - 
Custom. Why not. <br>
**Second digit** represents the **piece**. <br>

<ul>
    <li>First digit represents color. (0 for white, 1 for black)</li>
    <li>Second digit represents the piece. </li>
    <li>Third digit for the piece number?</li>
</ul>

| Color  | ID (First Digit) |
|--------|------------------|
 | Black  | 0                |
 | White  | 1                |

|  Piece   | ID (Second Digit) |
|:--------:|------------------:|
|   Pawn   |                 1 |
|  Knight  |                 2 |
|  Bishop  |                 3 |
|   Rook   |                 4 |

Since there are 8 pawns, the black pawns will have IDs 111 to 118 <br>

I think that differently identifies each piece on the board.
