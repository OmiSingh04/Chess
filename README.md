## Chess Piece ID - 
Custom. Why not. <br>
**First digit** represents **color (0 for white, 1 for black)** <br>
**Second digit** represents the **piece** <br>
| Piece         | ID            |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Pawn          | 1             |
| Knight        | 2             |
| Bishop        | 3             |
| Rook          | 4             |
| Queen         | 5             |
| King          | 6             |
**Third digit for the piece number ?** <br>
So like there are 8 pawns, so the black pawns will have IDs 111 to 118 <br>

i think that differently identifies each piece on the board.
